## <a name="status"></a>Status

This proposal is currently at stage 0 of the process.

## <a name="rationale-motivation"></a>Rationale and Motivation

There are a few ways to loop through a ordered list of integers, 0 through n-1 in JavaScript.

Using a for loop:

```javascript
//for syntax
for(let i=0; i < n; i++){
    //do something with i
}
```

Using a while loop:

```javascript
//while syntax
let i = 0;
while(i < n){
  //do something with i
  i++;
}
```

Both syntaxes are awkward syntax for a number of reasons:

- they require an explicit, non-constant, declaration of a placeholder,
  ```javascript
  let i = 0
  ```
- they requires an explicit test for said placeholder
  ```javascript
  i < n
  ```
- they require explicit incrementation step of said placeholder
  ```javascript
  i++
  ```

### <a name="prior-art:ruby"></a>Ruby

In Ruby, this can be achieved more elegantly using a number's [times method](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Integer.html#method-i-times):

```ruby
#number#times syntax
n.times do |i|
  #do something with i
end
```

This can also be achieved with [Ranges](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Range.html).

```ruby
#range#each syntax
(0..n).each do |i|
  #do something with i
end
```

```ruby
#for-in syntax
for i in 0..n
  #do something with i
end
```

### <a name="prior-art:python"></a>Python

Python also achieves this with the concept of [Ranges](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range).

```python
#for-in syntax
for i in range(n):
  #do something with i
```


### <a name="prior-art:coffeescript"></a>Coffeescript

Coffeescript also achieves this with the concept of [Comprehensions over Ranges](http://coffeescript.org/#loops).

```coffeescript
#for-in syntax
(#do something with i
  for i in [0..n-1])
```

## <a name="proposed-solution"></a>Proposed Solution: Make Numbers Iterable

We can do away with most of the awkwardness using the [iterator protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) to make numbers iterable, yielding 0 to n-1; or -n to -1, if n is negative.

### <a name="proposed-solution:for-of"></a>for-of loop

An iterable number can be the target of a [for-of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) loop, mirroring the for-in syntax from other languages:

```javascript
//for-of syntax
for(const i of n){
  //do something with i
}
```

### <a name="proposed-solution:conversion-array"></a>conversion to array

Iterable Numbers can be turned into arrays and use their methods, mimicking Ruby's range#each syntax and allowing other operations.

```javascript
[...n].forEach(i=>{
  //do something with i
});
[...n].map(i=>{
  //do something with i
});
[...n].filter(i=>{
  //do something with i
});
[...n].reduce((_,i)=>{
  //do something with i
});
```

Array.from works similarly for Iterable Numbers.

```javascript
Array.from(n);//[0, 1, ... n-1]
```

### <a name="proposed-solution:conversion-set"></a>conversion to set

Like any iterator, iterable Numbers can be converted into sets.

```javascript
new Set(n);//Set {0,1,...n-1}
```

#### <a name="side-note:set-theory"></a>set theory

On a side note, this fits well with the set theory of integers.

Compare the definition of [von Neumann ordinals]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-theoretic_definition_of_natural_numbers#Definition_as_von_Neumann_ordinals))

```
n := {x in N | x < n};
0 := {}
1 := {0}
2 := {0, 1}
3 := {0, 1, 2}
...
```

to results here.

```javascript
const zero  = new Set(0);//Set {}
const one   = new Set(1);//Set {0}
const two   = new Set(2);//Set {0, 1}
const three = new Set(3);//Set {0, 1, 2}
//...
```

### <a name="proposed-solution:variadic-functions"></a>variadic functions

Iterable Numbers can be spread across variadic functions.

```javascript
const sum = (...numbers)=>numbers.reduce((a, b)=>a+b, 0);
sum(...n);//0 + 1 + ... n-2 + n-1 === (n(n-1))/2
```

### <a name="proposed-solution:infinite-loops"></a>infinite loops

Using ```Infinity``` as an iterator provides a convenient method for potentially infinite loops.

Compare what we might have done before:

```javascript
let i = 0;
while(true){
  //do something with i
  if(/*some condition*/){
    break;
  }
  i++;
}
```
to what we would do now

```javascript
for(const i of Infinity){
  //do something with i
  if(/*some condition*/){
    break;
  }
}
```

### <a name="proposed-solution:destructuring"></a>destructuring

Iterable numbers can be destructured as arrays.

```javascript
const [,one,,three] = Infinity;//
one;//1
three;//3
```


### <a name="proposed-solution:negative-numbers"></a>negative numbers

Iterable negative numbers yield the sequence from -n up to -1 instead of 0 up to n-1.

```javascript
[... -n];//[-n, -n+1... -1]
```

### <a name="proposed-solution:combinations"></a>combinations

Iterable numbers can be combined with other iterable objects.

```javascript
[...-n, ...[0,0], ...n+1];//[-n, -n+1... -1, 0, 0, 0 1 ... n-1, n]
```

## <a name="specification"></a>Specification: Number.prototype[Symbol.iterator]

When Number.prototype[Symbol.iterator] is called, the following steps are taken:

- let N be Math.floor(_this_ value)
- if N is 0, return a generator in a "done" state.
- if N is Positive,
  return a generator that yields numbers 0 to N-1
- if N is Negative,
  return a generator that yields numbers N to -1

## <a name="implementation"></a>Implementation
The following code modifies the Number object's prototype, allowing any positive number, n, to be used as an iterator, yielding 0 up to n-1. (technically, the floor of n-1). Negative numbers return a generator yielding n up to -1.

### <a name="implementation:paste"></a>Paste

You can paste the following code into a console:

```javascript
Object.defineProperty(
Number.prototype,
Symbol.iterator,
{ value: function *(){
    const max = Math.max(0, Math.floor(this));
    let i = Math.min(0, this);
    while(i < max) {
      yield i;
      i+=1;
    }
    return this;
  }
});
```

and then try out the above examples to see this proposal in action.

### <a name="implementation:import"></a>Import

You can import the included "make-numbers-iterable.js" into a project.

```javascript
import './make-numbers-iterable';
//...
```

and then try out the above examples to see this proposal in action.

## <a name="faq"></a>FAQ

### <a name="faq:arbitrary-integers"></a>How does one interate between arbitrary integers?

Iterate up to the difference and add the smaller to each the iteration

```javascript
for(const i of (larger - smaller)){
  //do something with (smaller + i)
}
```

This will produce the sequence:

```javascript
[smaller, smaller + 1, ..., larger - 1]
```

Because of our definition for negative integers, it doesn't matter which numbers is smaller, as long as the [subtrahend](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Subtrahend.html) is added to the iteration. The following code produces the same sequence as the code above:

```javascript
for(const i of (smaller - larger)){
  //do something with (larger + i )
}
```

### <a name="faq:language-conflicts"></a>Does this cause language conflicts?

Currently if a number is given where an iterator is expected, a type error is thrown:

```javascript
TypeError: (var)[Symbol.iterator] is not a function(â€¦)
```

As such, this would not cause conflicts with existing working code.
